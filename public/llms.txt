# Purpose
# This website offers an interface for searching public GitHub repositories and
# uses OpenAI GPT-3.5 to summarise open issues. The summaries are generated
# on-demand and are not stored permanently.

# Data Usage
# • Input: Repository metadata, issue titles/bodies, first 5 comments per issue, and
#   up to 20 short source-code snippets are sent to the OpenAI API.
# • Output: A markdown summary shown to the user and discarded after the session.
# • No personal user data is sent to the LLM provider.

# Provider
llm_provider: OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo)

# Opt-out
# Repository owners who do not want their issues summarised can add the label
# `no-ai-summary` to their issues; these will be filtered out of the prompt.
